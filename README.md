The main learning objective from this assignment is creating a database with MongoDB and learn to have a website interact with it. Also learing how routes and templates are used to create a website easier.
***
The challanges that I ran into were being able to follow the flow of information through the site and what information was being passed with requests. I was able to overcome these by looking up different commands in the Express API reference. 
***
This allowed me to see how a website was set up with a database, how they interact, the way routes work, and how to implement html templates. It has given me a solid base for future web projects. Having to work through the challanges I did helped me learn the routes and what information is passed with requests.
